# [ ] Generate the game board and randomize the positions of the ships;
# [ ] Display everything correctly in a regular terminal window (80x24);
# [ ] Make the player able to shoot at a specific position in the board;
# [ ] Create the points system;
# [ ] Create the "Adversary" (AI) game loop;
# [ ] Make sure the game is finished when the last ship is destroyed.
